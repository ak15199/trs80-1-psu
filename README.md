# TRS-80 Model 1 Power Supply and Case

A lot of great work has been done by Dan Bear and others over the years to recreate the now virtually impossible to acquire power supply for the TRS-80 Model 1.

Researching prior art, I set out to create something that - although larger than the original - would not look out of place.

This repository contains the schematic and PCB layout along with the separate models required to 3D print the case. There's also a model to cover the exposed contacts on the fuse caddy.

Once built, you'll need to set the solder jumpers accordingly. There are two links to close if you're running on 110V, and one for 220V. Be careful to ensure that only the correctly labeled jumbers are closed.

Note that I have only built and tested the 110V version, so caution should be taken to test if you're building this to run on 220V.

If you would to use a different case and install an external fuse caddy, then there's a jumper for that too.

The lid of the case is designed to accept four 5.5 dia x 6mm long M4 threaded inserts. I used four M4 x 8mm pan head machine screws to retain the base.

Merge the TRS and Lid STLs if you have a dual extruder system, or don't load the TRS file if you prefer a recessed look. The lid will need to be rotated 180 degrees to avoid supports.

I salvaged the old 2-pin power cable from some old equipment. It was sufficiently thick and inflexible that a cable retainer wasn't needed. If you're not sure, then use a zip tie to bind the cable to the corresponding retaining hole on the PCB.
